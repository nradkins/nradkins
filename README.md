Hello! My name is Nick Adkins, and this welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I am an engineer, physicist, mathematician, programmer, tuba and piano player, composer, and SCUBA diver.
I view life as my one chance to live up to my full potential, so I want to try and work extremely hard to become the best person I can be.

I like to code in the following languages:

  Python
  Julia
  C++
  HTML/CSS
  MATLAB
  Git
  Windows Powershell and Command Line 
  Batch 

Some of my favorite libraries I have used are:

  Numpy
  Scipy
  Sympy
  Tensorflow 
  Kivy
  
I will continue to update this as I see fit!
